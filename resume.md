Achievement
- discovered that there were unnecessary api calls due to incorrect use of react hook. After fixing, unnecessary re-rendering of extraneous components is gone. I like to find and delete these pointless behaviors to improve performance.
- Using redis cash to manually flush the cash, automated it to have a cycle of 1 minute or 1 day.
- The above operation was implemented as a method so that it can be called.
- developed an exhibition that can be viewed on mobile.

# PERSONAL PROJECTS
Local management system created by me
- I have created a system that can store user-created regions. As db, postgreSQL and elasticsearch were used. Synchronized to postgreSQL using logstash. Refer to openstreetmap. It was developed before Google Maps maps came out. Made following the open street map.
